Due to my limited English writing ability, the article below is an AI translation of my original Chinese text.

And thanks for reading,I know sometimes I'm just complaining all things that ruin me.



**“This year, I kept losing.”**  

In abstract terms, I lost the courage to explore the world.
For the past year, I’ve been repeatedly disheartened by the coldness of our competitive education system—its betrayal of original ideals, its silent oppression of students. The companions who once ignited my soul now carry only worldly exhaustion in their eyes; the mentors who guided my path have left one after another under “publish or perish” policies; the friends who walked beside me have taken leaves of absence.

And I myself have been trapped in a quagmire of apathy, inner contradiction, and mental inertia—suffering deeply.
Instinctively, I chose to be an active helper rather than a detached observer. Yet limited by my capacity and perspective, I ended up making a complete mess of my own life.

When I recall the wish I made a year ago in high school—“The world changes every day, but I keep moving forward”—I feel a bitter irony, as if I’ve just realized I’m nothing more than a brain in a vat, dreaming of walking while rooted in place.

Is it that I failed to see the world clearly—or is the world simply this way?
I fell into a spiral of self-pity: “Why me?”—repeatedly offering unnecessary waves of negative emotion to a string of random, yet densely packed, misfortunes.

**Fragments:**

1. January 1, just after midnight—I sat alone by Siyuan Lake to welcome the new year. Distant fireworks sounded muffled by distance; nearby students shouted, “Happy New Year!” A faint warmth of celebration began to stir in my chest—yet Shanghai’s relentless winter dampness crept upward from my feet, inch by inch.
“A total loser,” I thought.

1. July 4—In a café filled with soft music and hushed chatter, the calm one everyone called “rational” was overwhelmed by a tidal wave of emotion—ears ringing, head pounding, on the verge of shouting. In truth, I don’t even know if I managed to keep my voice down that day. I tried not to accuse or judge; instead, I asked gently, “What are you afraid of? What worries you?”
But it led nowhere.
Sitting across from you was someone who had pulled himself out of despair—just for you—hoping to walk alongside you again in pursuit of what we love, free from shame or pain over the past.
We once shared a dream (different from my own ideal), yet became strangers to each other.
The agony of watching helplessly from the shore has burned in me ever since.
It took me a long time to untangle myself from that irreplaceable chapter. Since then, I’ve been alone.

1. November 21—After a run, I learned a close friend had taken a leave of absence. I sat by the soccer goal at Nan Ti and spent half an hour on the phone with another friend, cursing the university I’d defended against all advice. Perhaps it was the heavy night dew—but the following evening, I spiked a fever of 39°C.

2. December 31—today—I heard that a teacher full of educational ideals is leaving due to the university’s “publish or perish” policy. I nearly cried. At my most lost, he showed me direction and gave me the strength to move forward.

3. I’ve seen classmates rendered speechless by rankings. In this school, the top 30% enjoy generous privileges—while the silent majority remains unseen.

2025 is the Year of the Snake. This year, I lived as though coiled tightly by a python—forcing smiles, trying to make everyone around me happy, yet failing utterly. I grew cynical, withdrew from crowds as much as possible, and hid my heart in empty corners.

**I severed ties with Camus and adopted Kafka as my spiritual teacher.**

Yet, fortunately, within this labyrinthine castle, I managed to find a few climbing holds—small, but enough to grip.
I discovered a new sport. I joined a research group and began my first-ever research project. I’m trying to make up for the wasteland of the past year. And I wonder: if I first strengthen my inner world—if I let it grow rich and resilient—then return to exploring the world… might that be better?
