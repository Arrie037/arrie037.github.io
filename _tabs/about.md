# Hi!This is Arrie.
hola!I'm Yingzhu Wang,a sophomore undergratuate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.My English name is Arrie, so feel free to call me Ari or Zhu(my Chinese name shortened),or Cuzzi——that’s my nickname.

# About This Website
This website hosts my scattered thoughts and ongoing experiments—driven by my pursuit of academic ideals and my search for meanings in life.

Though I often feel pessimistic, believing the world is getting worse (or perhaps I’m just seeing it more clearly than before), I still want to do something helpful,for me and people.

And it all starts here.
